# C++ Code Collection

This repository contains various C++ programs to demonstrate basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures. Below is a summary of each program included in this repository.

## 1. **Merge Linked Lists at a Specific Position (`merge_linked_lists.cpp`)**

### Description:
This program demonstrates how to insert one linked list into another at a specified position (`k`). It takes input for two linked lists and merges the second list into the first list at the provided position. 

### Features:
- Creates two linked lists using input data.
- Reverses the elements of both linked lists before inserting.
- Merges the second linked list into the first linked list at a user-specified position.
- Prints the resulting linked list.

### Input Example:
Number of nodes A: 3 Insert nodes A: 10 20 30 Number of nodes B: 2 Insert nodes B: 50 60 Location: 2

## 2. **Rectangle Class with Constructors and Methods (`rectangle_class.cpp`)**

### Description:
This program demonstrates the use of constructors and methods in a C++ class. It defines a `RECT` class with attributes for position (`x`, `y`), dimensions (`w`, `h`), and color. Two constructors are provided to create a rectangle with default or custom attributes.

### Features:
- Two constructors to initialize a rectangle: one with default size and color, and another with custom dimensions and color.
- A method to print the rectangle's attributes.

### Input Example:
No direct input. The rectangles are created directly in the code.

### Output Example:
300 200 100 100 WHITE 400 500 50 40 GREEN

## 3. **Linked List Operations (`linked_list_operations.cpp`)**

### Description:
This program demonstrates how to perform basic linked list operations in C++. It allows the user to insert new nodes, print the linked list, and manipulate the list.

### Features:
- Defines a simple linked list and performs operations like insertion and printing.
- Demonstrates linked list traversal and node insertion.

## 4. **Circle Class with Methods for Perimeter and Area Calculation (`circle_class.cpp`)**

### Description:
This program demonstrates a simple class `Circle` that calculates the perimeter and area of a circle given its radius. It includes constructors to initialize the radius and methods to compute the perimeter and area.

### Features:
- Calculates the perimeter and area of a circle based on its radius.
- Includes a getter and setter for the radius.

### Input Example:
No direct input. The circle is created with a given radius in the code.

### Output Example:
Radius=30 Area of circle=2827.43 Perimeter of circle=188.495
